# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This project continues working with Python data structures.  
You will learn how to use sets and dictionaries to store, update, and access data.  
You will also practice looping through nested structures and writing clean, efficient code using Python tools like map, lambda, and list comprehensions.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what sets are and how to use them
- Understand what dictionaries are and how to use them
- Remove duplicates from a list using a set
- Access, update, add, and delete dictionary items
- Loop through dictionaries and nested structures
- Use common dictionary methods
- Use lambda, map, filter, and reduce
- Use list and dictionary comprehensions
- Work with matrices and deep copies without modifying the original structure

## Requirements
- Python3 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Files must end with a new line
- First line of every script: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (2.7.*)
- No importing modules unless allowed
- All files must be executable
