# Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project introduces the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.  
You will learn how to define classes, create objects, use instance attributes and class attributes,  
write methods, and understand how Python handles object construction through the `__init__` method.  
The project builds the foundation you need to structure larger programs using OOP principles.

- Use and understand the purpose of the `self` parameter.
- Understand the role of the `__init__` constructor.
- Create multiple instances from the same class.
- Access attributes and methods using the dot notation.
- Modify object attributes after creation.
- Explain the difference between class attributes and instance attributes.
