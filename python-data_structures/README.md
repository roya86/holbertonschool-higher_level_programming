# Python - Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

## Description
This project introduces Python’s built-in data structures, focusing on lists and tuples.
You will learn how to access, update, slice, and manipulate sequences, understand the
differences between lists and tuples, and apply Pythonic techniques to solve problems efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what lists are and how to use them
- Understand the difference between lists and strings
- Use common list methods and operations
- Understand what tuples are and when to use them
- Perform sequence unpacking
- Use the built-in len() function with sequences
